# PCB Breakout Board
## Schematic
In this lab a PCB breakout board with reset circuitry was designed. This circuit was drawn in the schematic editor in diptrace, then the pcb was designed with the PCB editor. Only one component had to be drawn in the component editor, this was the MSP430FR2311IPW20R.
